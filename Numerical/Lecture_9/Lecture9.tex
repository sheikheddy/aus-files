\section*{MÃ¼ller's Method}

Based on approximating the function in the neighborhood of the root by a quadratic polynomial.

\section*{Technique}

A \underline{2nd} degree polynomial is made to fit 3 points near a root, $ (x_0, f(x_0)) $; $ (x_1, f(x_1)) $ \& $ (x_2, f(x_2)) $ \& the zero of the polynomial is found using the quadratic formula.
